  <p>I am currently working as a Customer Experience Professional at Detective Desk. I have been working here for almost 4 years now. Detective Desk is an Australian Web-based Database company which provides service to banks, insurance, collections,
    investigations, and finance companies. Something weirdly interesting about me is that I love sarcastic humor.</p>
